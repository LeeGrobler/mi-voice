# MiVoice

MiVoice (pronounced "My Voice") is an open-source mobile application developed using React Native. This app is designed for members of the autistic community and others with speech disabilities. It allows users to take photos or upload images of common items and phrases, and represent them in-app via large, colorful buttons. When a button is tapped, the app speaks out the associated phrase, empowering users to communicate more effectively.

## Figma Mockups

I am currently designing the app. You can view my progress and contribute by visiting the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/s9v0UEdZGY5b5UDYaYvERy/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=PiGAExKO8KGINuVa-0).

## Development Roadmap

The roadmap for Version 1 is still under construction. But here is a general direction:

1. Complete Figma mockups for app.
2. Set up basic navigation in the app using React Navigation.
3. Develop main screen with buttons for common phrases.
4. Implement image capture and gallery upload functionality.
5. Integrate Text-to-Speech functionality for each button.
6. Implement custom button functionality (user-defined images and phrases).
7. Testing and bug fixes.
8. Prepare for first release.
